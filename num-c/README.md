### Provide answers to the following questions.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): 10
  - Task 2 (Speeding up matrix operations): 10
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - <b>This project was pretty interesting. I found it cool that in this project, we did many things that I haven't learned about in other CS classes. In particular, working with the parallel threads was something that is useful in real programming, that we were able to make use of in this project.</b>
- What did you learn?
  - <b>I learned more about intel vectors, parallel threads, and mainly how to optimize my code so that it can be faster. I didn't know that how we programmed would affect the speed of our programs this much, so this project was kind of eye opening.</b>
- Is there anything you would change?
  - <b>In this project, I would change how we are graded because it seems to be a little harsh, in addition I would not make the project due in the middle of the week after Thanksgiving, as it forces students to work on the project when they should be spending time with their families.</b>
